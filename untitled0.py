"""Histogram Analysis: These histograms help understand the distribution of scores in Math, Reading, and Writing. You can easily see if the scores are normally distributed or skewed, which can inform decisions about statistical analysis or interventions for students who may need extra help.

BOX Analysis: Box plots provide a visual summary of the distribution of scores, showing quartiles, outliers, and the overall spread of data. They are helpful for comparing the distribution of scores across different subjects.

BAR Analysis: This bar plot helps visualize the gender distribution in the dataset. It can be useful for analyzing gender-based disparities in performance or other aspects of education.

Scatter Analysis: This scatter plot helps identify any potential relationships or correlations between Math and Reading scores, with gender as a visual indicator. It can be used to assess if performance in one subject tends to correlate with performance in another.

PIE Analysis: Analysis: The pie chart provides a visual representation of the distribution of students across different ethnicities. This can be useful for understanding the diversity of the student population.

These visualizations make various aspects of the student performance dataset easier to analyze, including score distributions, gender and ethnicity distributions, and potential relationships between variables.
